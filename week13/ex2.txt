Exercise 2

1) Recovery uses possible methods: Preemption, Rollback, Killing processes.

(a) Preemption is based on temporarily taking a resource away from one process and give it to another process.
Disadvantage of this strategy: taking a resource away is highly dependent on the nature of it.

(b) Rollback requires writing a state to a file so that it can be restarted later.

Disadvantage of this strategy: it requires additional memory; after abort we need to repeat
steps of a process again, which might lead to time consumption.

(c) Killing processes - is a simple way for solving a deadlock problem.
Disadvantage of this strategy: for some processes it cannot be applicable because of ill effects. 


2) Avoidance requires analysis of processes to determine in advance whether there will be a deadlock or not.
For example, it can be done via Banker's algorithm.
Disadvantage of this strategy: it works only if the certain information about processes is available in advance.


3) Prevention attacks four conditions: Mutual-Exclusion, Hold-and-Wait, No-Preemption, Circular wait to avoid a deadlock.
Disadvantage of this strategy: resource allocation constraints lead to the inability to parallelism.
